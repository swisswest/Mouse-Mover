# üñ±Ô∏è Mouse Mover ‚Äì GUI Version

This program automatically moves the mouse and press "shift" at regular intervals to prevent the computer from going idle or locking. The graphical user interface (GUI) allows you to start and stop the process and define the delay time in seconds.

## üì¶ Installation / Setup

If you already have the compiled EXE version, no Python installation is required.

If you built the application using Python and PyInstaller, it was likely done with the following command:

```bash
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --noconsole main.py
```

## Infos

if you work on the Project and you change something, pls delete the .exe file and create a new one before you commit. You will find the command above. Thanks ;)
